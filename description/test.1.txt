1 thread
6 total files

Group Number:5
Purpose: Test 1 is to test 6 files of increasing size in 1 thread orientation
How it works: By inputing all 6 files at the same initial and decay time 0.5, setting threads to 1 on input.
Expected result:
SJF:
If the multiple files come in to the queue, we will expected them sort by the
size of the file. Sometimes they will finish too soon before another file join
in the queue.

RR:
Large files have to be processed in size quantum of 8KB. Files that arrive
early start to process, later file can join and each of them take the turn.

MLFB:
Files first join the 8KB queue, and 64KB queue and finally Round Robin. The order
of completion of the process depends on the processing time and arrival time of
each file.
