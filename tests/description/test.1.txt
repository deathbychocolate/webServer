1 thread
6 total files

Group Number:5
Purpose: Test 1 is to test 6 files of increasing size in 1 thread orientation
How it works: By inputing all 6 files at the same initial and decay time 0.5, setting threads to 1 on input.
Expected result:
SJF:
If the multiple files come in to the queue, we will expected them sort by the
size of the file. Sometimes they will finish too soon before another file join
in the queue. The same intial time results in no intial misorder, just size ordered 1 2 3 4 5 6.

RR:
Large files have to be processed in size quantum of 8KB. Files that arrive
early start to process, later file can join and each of them take the turn.
The round robin will passed all the files through atleast twice, but order of size may change as 1 2 and 3 are same initial time and number of dequeues. (1|2|3) 4 5 6

MLFB:
Files first join the 8KB queue, and 64KB queue and finally Round Robin. The order
of completion of the process depends on the processing time and arrival time of
each file. The fact that file 1 is larger than 8 kb will result in the order 
being very similar to RR, but the arrival could make the intial (1|2|3|4|5) 6
