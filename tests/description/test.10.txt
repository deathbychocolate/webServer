Test files are generated by shell script.
From size 101KB to 105KB.
5 files in total
64 threads

Group Number:5
Purpose: Test 10 is to test 5 files of large size in 64 thread orientation
How it works: By inputing all 5 files at the same initial and decay time setting threads to 64 on input, but see if the large size affects order with largest thread size.
Expected result: 1 2 3 4 5

SJF:
If the multiple files come in to the queue, we will expected them sort by the
size of the file. 

RR:
Large files have to be processed in size quantum of 8KB. Files that arrive
start to process, will take as given so order is hard to expect with same initail time.

MLFB:
Files first join the 8KB queue, and 64KB queue and finally Round Robin. The order
of completion of the process depends on the processing time with same arrival time of
each file.
