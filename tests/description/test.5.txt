8 threads
6 total files

Group Number:5
Purpose: Test 5 is to test 6 files of incrementing size decrementing intial time in 8 thread orientation
How it works: By inputing all 6 incrementing sized files at the same decay time and larger decrementing initial time setting threads to 8 on input.
Expected result: Hard to know since the order will change on the speed of processing the file chunks. RR 654321

SJF:
If the multiple files come in to the queue, we will expected them sort by the
size of the file. Sometimes they will finish too soon before another file join
in the queue. This will put the file at 6 first in the queue, but the 128kb file 
would be running at that time so 6 1 2 3 4 5

RR:
Large files have to be processed in size quantum of 8KB. Files that arrive
early start to process, later file can join and each of them take the turn. 
Size will result is size sorted order 1 2 3 4 5 6

MLFB:
Files first join the 8KB queue, and 64KB queue and finally Round Robin. The order
of completion of the process depends on the processing time and arrival time of
each file. Same result as RR.
