8 threads
file size ranges from 8-128kb
6 files in total

Group Number:5
Purpose: Test 7 is to test 6 files of incrementing size in 8 thread orientation with decay times that cause them to have same arrival time as the files arriving a 1 2 and 3.
How it works: By inputing all 6 files of incrementing initial and decay time setting threads to 8 on input results in conflicting file times.

Expected result: 1 2 3 4 5 6
Since the increasing jobs makes the shortest job this result, the round robin may result differently.

SJF:
If the multiple files come in to the queue, we will expected them sort by the
size of the file. Sometimes they will finish too soon before another file join
in the queue. Order should be size so the delayed files should run before their intial time pairs. 

RR:
Large files have to be processed in size quantum of 8KB. Files that arrive
early start to process, later file can join and each of them take the turn. Order would be the intials of 1 3 5 2 4 6 since the intial times give us the different order.

MLFB:
Files first join the 8KB queue, and 64KB queue and finally Round Robin. The order
of completion of the process depends on the processing time and arrival time of
each file. Order should be based on size. This order could differ because of how fast 8KB could be processed compared to the intial times of 2 4 and 6.
